Yes, I finally started working on this old, neglected project...

But I am not having fun at all. Why? I don't speak codes.

So I'm shooting in the dark here -- hence the reason for some commented out lines and Qt baby steps tutorial being in the project.

I do know you talented people are currently reaching for adrenaline and/or the help because the code is so terrible, but trust me -- I suck.
