# PseudoGamer
Yes, I finally started working on this old, neglected project...

But I am not having fun at all. Why? I don't speak codes.

So I'm shooting in the dark here -- hence the reason for some commented out lines and Qt baby steps tutorial being in the project.

I do know you talented people are currently reaching for adrenaline and/or the help because the code is so terrible, but trust me -- I suck.

## TODO
- Add support for running the program and killing it after designated length of time
- Add loop and shuffle for list
- Make list work
- Make add button work
- Make reading from the list work
- Ensure only one thread of Steam-Idle.exe exists
- List select
- List up/down
- Literally make everything work
- Crash handler
- Process check
- Make App ID accept only numbers
